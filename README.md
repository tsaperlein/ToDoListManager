# Description
Implement a to-do list manager with features such as adding tasks, setting due dates, marking tasks as complete, and categorizing tasks. This is a practical project that can be expanded with additional features like reminders.

# Prerequisites:
### Java Development Kit (JDK):
Ensure that you have Java JDK installed on your system. You can download and install it from the official Oracle website or adopt OpenJDK.

# Steps:
1. Clone the Repository:

- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Run the following command to clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tsaperlein/ToDoListManager.git
```
This will download the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

Change your current working directory to the cloned repository:
```bash
cd ToDoListManager
```

3. Open MainApp.java:

Use a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) to open the MainApp.java file. You can use commands like **nano**, **vim**, or open the file in your preferred IDE.

4. Review Code and Dependencies:

Review the code in MainApp.java to ensure that it meets your requirements.
Check for any dependencies mentioned in the project documentation or source code comments.

5. Compile the Code (if necessary):

If the project requires compilation, use the following command to compile the Java code:
```bash
javac MainApp.java
```

6. Run the Code:

Execute the following command to run the Java program:
```bash
java MainApp
```
This command assumes that the main class is MainApp.
